    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="para">
        <p> In life you will always find people, who donâ€™t want to watch you fail. My
            name is <strong>Gladys Kyenze.</strong> I have been doing programming for a
            few years now. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology from KCA University. I have
            worked in a few companies
            like Gertude Hospital and Safari park Hotel.</p>
        <p>The main reason why am doing programming now is to boost the tech degree, which I already have
            and get good jobs in my future.
